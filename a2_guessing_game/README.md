# Rust Guessing Game

### Description
The program is a typical guessing game. You're asked to guess a specific number between 1 and 100, for which the program will tell you it was incorrect or correct. It will also comment on how many times you've guessed, probably with the intention to degrade the user for his failures. The program is a part of the course D7018E.
